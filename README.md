Final project for COSC231 - Addicting Games Site

A few of the features we have implemented:

Seperated the files into a heirarchy:

AddictingGamesFolder:
  cssFolder: styles.css
  javaScriptFolder: main.js
  index.html
  
Styled our front page using stylesheets. Targeted classes and id's
by using '.' and '#'. Also implemented some CSS animation using webkit.

Imported css and javaScript files from within index.html. Also implemented
some javascript functions to manipulate the DOM based on buttonClicks.
